A common way of quickly achieving this goal was by utilising [Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), however it's a little too fiddly to setup, renew certifcates later. it would be to automate all process entirely, including downloading certificate, certificate renewal....

[Brendan] writes a nice [article]((https://medium.com/weareservian/automagical-https-with-docker-and-go-4953fdaf83d2) ) about this.

I've tried it in my project, it's perfect. highly recommond to read it.
