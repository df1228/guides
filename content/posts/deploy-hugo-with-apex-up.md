[apex up](https://github.com/apex/up) is a great tool made by tj.  

to know what it is capable of, you can read [introducing apex up](https://medium.com/@tjholowaychuk/introducing-apex-800824ffaa70) and [github.com/apex/up](https://github.com/apex/up).

here is my experience for deploy hugo site with apex up. 

## 1. first make sure you configure aws IAM right.

create a [IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) user with appropriate permission in aws iam console.

make sure [static-basic](https://github.com/apex/up-examples/tree/master/oss/static-basic) demo can be deployed just using `up`. run `up url -o` to check your deploy.

you can use `up stack delete` to destroy the entire stack.


## 2. create a up.json in hugo site root folder.

```json
{
  "name": "app",
  "profile": "apex",
  "regions": [
    "ap-northeast-1"
  ],
  "type": "static",
  "static": {
    "dir": "public"
  },
  "stages": {
	  "staging": {
      "static": {
        "prefix": "staging/"
      },
      "hooks":{
        "build": "hugo -b /staging/"
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "static": {
        "prefix": "production/"
      },
      "hooks":{
        "build": "hugo -b /production/"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

``` 
# .gitignore
*
!public/**
```

details about config as below:  

  
* profile is the name in your ~/.aws/credetails config in first step.

* region is the region you want to deploy

* type static specifiy up static server to serve it.

* dir specify folder you want to deploy. by default the current directory (.) is served, however you can change this using the dir setting.

* hooks overwrites up default build task. `up config` validate and output configuration with defaults applied.  

* stages config stage overrides.


just change the name for your site when you deploy. maybe profile and regions.
