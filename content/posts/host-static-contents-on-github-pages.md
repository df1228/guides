[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)  is a static site hosting service designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages directly from a GitHub repository.

However from repository settings / Github Pages, only master, master/doc option can be selected. 

Actually there is another way to quickly host your repo's static content with command line. 

Create a `gh-pages` branch, push your static contents to this branch. fire up a browser then open `http://username.github.com/repo`


```
git checkout --orphan gh-pages  
git reset --hard
echo hello github pages > index.html
git commit -am "create index.html"
```

when working with hugo, it's really helpful to create a little script for deploy contents from `./public` generated by `hugo` command
